# Interactive DOM Events Handling

This project demonstrates basic DOM event handling in JavaScript, including mouse enter events and input filtering.

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `style_event.css`: The CSS file for styling the page.
- `app_event.js`: The JavaScript file containing the event handlers.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Features
- **Mouse Enter Event**: Changes the color of the text when the mouse enters the designated area.
- **Input Filtering**: Filters the input to only allow alphabetic characters and displays the input dynamically.
